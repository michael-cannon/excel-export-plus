Excel Export Plus easily exports any post type in an Excel-friendly format. Options: Custom Post Types, fields, meta data, filters, and more.


== Description ==

Excel Export Plus allows you to export any type of post data (CPTs included) to excel-friendly formats using an intuitive interface. You have the option to select multiple Post Types, specific fields, meta/custom fields, filter values, and split files by number of records.

Supported export formats are XLS, XLSx, and CSV.

*Warning* File splits of more than 500 records each may not work depending upon your server's PHP memory limit and timeout settings. You can still export 10,000 records. You'll just have 20 files to deal with, than one.

This plugin is platform agnostic by using the open-source PHPExcel library that generates Microsoft-based files without the need to run on a Windows platform.

= FOSS Disclaimer =

Two open source libraries are included with this plugin (without changes).

* [PHPExcel 1.8.0](http://phpexcel.codeplex.com)
* [Bootstrap 2.3.2](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)

== Installation ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I report an issue? =

In the [support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/excel-export-plus) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/michael-cannon/excel-export-plus/issues).

= The "Export" is taking too long and generates an error =

This may happen due to memory limitations of your webserver. Unfortunatelly this cannot be bypassed through code and can only be resolved by requesting you webserver to change your memory limits or by turning on the option "Multiple Files" limiting the amount of records within each file. Try to process 500 or less records at a time.

= Why can't I export comments? =

Comments are not yet supported by the plugin. It may be in a future version.

= How do I remove the menu item? =

Use filter `eep_menu_page_capability` to adjust the capability allowed access.
